# closed B-spline curve

![AnVIL Image](./output/wrapping_controlps.png)
Referencd from [link](https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/spline/B-spline/bspline-curve-closed.html), it seems
two methods can be used to creat closed b-spline curve which are Wrapping Control Points and Wrapping Knots. But this lecture doesn' t 
explain specific algortihm in detail, which may be still hard for people to understand and put it into action.

Therefore, I provide my algorithm by using these two methods.
